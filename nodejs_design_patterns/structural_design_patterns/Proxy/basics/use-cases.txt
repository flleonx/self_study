A proxy can be useful in several circumstances, for example:

- Data validation: The proxy validates the input before forwarding it to
  the subject.

- Security: The proxy verifies that the client is authorized to perform the
  operation, and it passes the request to the subject only if the outcome of
  the check is positive.

- Caching: The proxy keeps an internal cache so that the proxied operations
  are executed on the subject only if the data is not yet present in the cache.

- Lazy initialization: If creating the subject is expensive, the proxy can delay
  it unil it's really necessary.

- Logging: The proxy intercepts the method invocations and the relative parameters,
  recording them as they happen.

- Remote objects: The proxy can take a remote object and make it apper local.
